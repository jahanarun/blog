Let the first post in this blog be about setting up this blog.

# Pre requisites:

* Azure account
* Custom domain (optional)
* Some knowhow on git and GitHub

_I am going to guide you with few links which has a good write-up on how to acheive this. I didn't want to replicate the steps in this post as it may go outdated._


This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate static site generator. It's pretty simple and easy to people with no prior blogging or technical experience.

You can follow the guide [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to create a simple site in your localhost.

After that, you will need to deploy your application to Azure, ideally Github. Follow the article [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo#deploy-your-web-app) to deploy to Azure.

For configuring custom domain, you will need to purchase a domain. I liked to managing my domain with Cloudflare. So, I transferred my domain to Cloudflare and I liked this promise from Cloudflare

[Cloudflare Promise](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-registrar/)
>From the price side it’s even simpler: **we promise to never charge you anything more than the wholesale price each TLD charges.** That’s true the first year, and it’s true every subsequent year. If you register your domain with Cloudflare Registrar you’ll always pay the wholesale price with no markup.



## Optional things to do:
* Create a logo for your blog. I used this [Design Studio Logo Maker](https://designstudio.smallseotools.com/logo-ideas)

* Select good theme for your site from [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
